## 📋 Project Overview
Analyzed **ten years of Air Quality Index (AQI) data (2013–2023)** across U.S. states to identify long-term pollution trends and highlight regions with improvement or deterioration.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Canva  
- **Collaboration:** Google Docs  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Collected and cleaned AQI datasets by U.S. state and year.  
2. Calculated median AQI changes between 2013 and 2023.  
3. Visualized improvements and declines using Python and Power BI.  
4. Mapped maximum recorded AQI (2023) using geographic coordinates.

## 📈 Results Summary
| Metric | Finding |
|---------|----------|
| 🟢 Improved States | California, Oregon, Washington, New York, Illinois |
| 🔴 Declined States | Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, New Mexico |
| Overall Trend | National improvement but persistent western spikes due to wildfires |

## 🧠 My Contributions (Mintesnot Yimer)
- Processed raw AQI data using **pandas** and **numpy**.  
- Built **Python visualizations** (bar plots, frequency polygons).  
- Helped integrate data into **Power BI** for map visualization.  
- Summarized results and co-designed the **poster layout**.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The analysis revealed a general improvement in U.S. air quality over the decade but also emphasized growing **regional disparities**.  
Western states remain heavily affected by **wildfires**, while many eastern states have seen consistent progress.
